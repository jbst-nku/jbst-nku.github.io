            <div class="det-abstract"> In this study, the effects of fiber laying direction (parallel or cross) which is also mentioned as fiber orientation, and fiber blend ratio on the permeability properties of nonwoven fabrics produced with viscose/polyester blends were investigated. For this purpose, nonwoven fabrics made of 50% viscose/50% polyester, 40% viscose/60% polyester, and 30% viscose/70% polyester were produced with card line, and to get the final fabric, these webs were overlaid prior to hydroentaglement bonding in parallel or cross directions. Then, air permeability properties, water vapor permeability, and capillary absorption properties were measured to determine the effect of fiber orientation and fiber blend ratio on the comfort related properties of the fabrics. It was found that the fiber blend ratios affected the comfort related properties of the nonwoven fabrics such as air and water vapor permeability and capillary absorption properties. In general, as the percentage of viscose fiber in the fabric decreased and the PES fiber ratio therefore increased, a decrease in the comfort properties of the fabrics was observed. Furthermore, the fiber orientation in the fabrics also played an important role in the comfort related properties. Since the fibers in the fabric structure were parallel to the machine direction in parallel laying, air permeability, capillary absorption (wicking), and water vapor permeability results of these parallel laid fabrics were higher compared to the cross-laid nonwoven fabrics in which the fibers were randomly placed.</div>
