            <div class="det-abstract"> Maize cropping technology during the last decades was improved and breeders created many high-yielding maize hybrid varieties. There has not been the same level of success with improving maize grain quality, especially crude protein content. This work aimed to study promising hybrid varieties and inbred lines of maize with high grain crude protein content for involvement in the breeding process. Four commercial hybrid varieties, FAO 300 to FAO 600, four new experimental hybrids and six inbred lines of maize were tested for crude protein content in grain, crude protein yield and grain yield. Kneja 435 from the commercial hybrid varieties was found to have relatively high grain yield and the highest crude protein yield. It is very suitable for production of animal feed. №12 (CM 5625 x ХМ 88/113 о2) from the experimental hybrids is considered promising due to the high protein content and adequate grain yield. It is recommended to be used for high crude protein selection. B 311 and CM 5625 maize inbred lines had high grain crude protein content and, along with the established line HM 532 BC, can be used in the selection for creation of high-protein maize hybrids. These findings are a contribution to the breeding process of maize.</div>
