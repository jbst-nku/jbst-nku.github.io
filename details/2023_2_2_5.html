        <div class="det-abstract">Site-based observation results in the paper industry were investigated in order to ensure that the workers in
            industries can observe Behavior Based Safety Observations (BBSOs) and understand the culture of
            occupational safety. Observations include both routine and non-routine activities. Within the scope of the
            this study, the observation forms prepared as a result of the interviews with the senior management of the
            company and the employees were filled and then employee BBSOs assessments were made. Then, the
            results of these evaluations were processed on the eBA Document, Record and Workflow Management
            System, where the entries of risky findings and safe findings, how many observation forms the employees
            gave, and the explanations of which departments they belonged to and the statistics of the data obtained
            were kept. The data entered into the eBA Document, Record and Workflow Management System was
            proactively and quickly ended with the intervention of unsafe behaviors with the approval of the senior
            management. Action plans for behavior change within the scope of Occupational Safety Leadership
            Practices (OSLPs) were created and monitored in the facility by comparing Accident Frequency Rate (AFR)
            and % Risk Ratio (RR). In line with these objectives, eBA responsibilities and competencies were
            determined, eBA behavior committee and Reporting System were established and a Safety Program that
            Integrated Behavior-Based Safety (IBBS) and Traditional Safety (TS) methods were described. In 2015,
            when TS methods were predominant and Behavior-Based Safety (BBS) observations were first
            implemented, AFR and % RR were found 2,15 and 6.0, respectively, while TS methods and BBSOs were
            more actively used together with eBA Document, Record and Workflow Management System in 2016 AFR
            0, % RR 0,20 have fallen.</div>
