            <div class="det-abstract"> Plastics are one of the refractory pollutants produced in many and varied forms using chemistry and materials science. Microplastics (MPs), which are formed as a result of plastics breaking down into small pieces, are a new indicator that indicates that the plastic footprint of humans is growing today and this has become a risk for the general living health and sustainable environment. A wide range of products such as personal care products, shampoos, detergents, toothpastes, textiles, bags, shoes, car tires, and foods contain MPs. Depending on the point of use, they are either directly released to the air, water and soil or they break down into secondary MPs in the environment where they are discharged. Especially by means of domestic wastewater, plenty of MPs enter the sewage system on a daily basis; therefore, wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) draw attention as an important source of MP pollution in coastal or surface waters such as sea, lake, river. There is still a limited number of studies on this subject in the literature and it has become the focus of many researchers around the world. So, the aim of this review paper is to evaluate the current scientific studies on MP pollution subject. On the scope of this aim, it includes discussions on the sources, most accurate detection and treatment perspectives of MPs. Thus, it takes attention to the subject that if awareness, encouragement, guidance, and legal restrictions, that will reduce our plastic footprint, are not put into effect rapidly, it will be inevitable to cause the new health problems, genetic diseases, increasing criminal cases, and environmental problems such as air, water and soil quality.</div>
