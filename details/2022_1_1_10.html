            <div class="det-abstract"> What kind of future awaits the act of walking indicating that a person has started to live, with the increasing car dependency? This manuscript evaluates people's perception of space in modern cities depending on their walking ability and conducts a literature research by focusing on streets as urban open spaces. It sets the walking as a center as a basic sense increasing the urban experience, in addition to basic senses of human beings. Initially, the relationship between urban spaces and citizens will be examined in order to reveal the normal state of walking, which is the most basic human activity in the networks of the city. Then, with the concept of pedestrian in the street,  it will be ensured that the principles of walkability will be investigated within the scope of people's perception of space, and the determinants of attractiveness of streets will be revealed. The aim of this research is to determine the walkability criteria on the streets, as a part of the public open spaces of the city. As a result of the literature research, the criteria for walkability on streets were determined as accessibility, pyhsical form and design, usage, networks and others to built or suggest more livable urban spaces regarding walkability.</div>
